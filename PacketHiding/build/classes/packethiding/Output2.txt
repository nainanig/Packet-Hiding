Packet-Hiding Methods for Preventing Selective Jamming Attacks
Abstract
--------
The open nature of the wireless medium leaves it vulnerable to intentional interference attacks, typically referred to as jamming.
This intentional interference with wireless transmissions can be used as a launchpad for mounting Denial-of-Service attacks on wireless
networks. Typically, jamming has been addressed under an external threat model.
